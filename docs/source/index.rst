JemosLite RV32I Processor
=========================

Welcome to the JemosLite RV32I Processor documentation!

This processor core is a simple implementation of the RISC-V RV32I instruction set architecture, which I did
to learn more about RISC-V and digital design using Verilog.

This documentation provides an overview of the processor architecture, detailing its components and functionality.
It also describes how it can be integrated into a larger system, and synthesized for FPGA devices.

The project is Open Source, and you can find the source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/jemos/jpc>`_. Feel free
to contribute, report issues, or ask questions.
